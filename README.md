WHO?
This program is for people who want to create silly and entertaining stories by filling in blanks with their own words.




WHAT?
Itâ€™s a Mad Libs game where you enter different types of words like nouns, verbs, and adjectives. The program then automatically puts those words into a story to make a fun and unique story every time.
